- Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class.
```java
public class Myclass 
{
 public static void main(String[] args) 
  {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}
```
In our example, we named the class ```Myclass```. <br />
- A class should always start with an **UPPERCASE** first letter. <br />
- When saving the file, save it using the class name and add **".java"** to the end of the filename.
- Java is case-sensitive: ```MyClass``` and ```myclass``` has different meaning.
- Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.
Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces
