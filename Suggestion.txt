public class Main 
{
	....
}
-> Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. 
In our example, we named the class Main.
-> A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.
-> When saving the file, save it using the class name and add ".java" to the end of the filename.
-> Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.
