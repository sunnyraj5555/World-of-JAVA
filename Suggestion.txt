public class Myclass 
{
	....
}
-> Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. 
In our example, we named the class Myclass.
-> A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.
-> When saving the file, save it using the class name and add ".java" to the end of the filename.
-> Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.

public class Main 
{
  public static void main(String[] args) 
  {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}

-> main() method
The main() method is required and you will see it in every Java program:
NOTE: every Java program has a class name which must match the 
filename, and that every program must contain the main() method.

-> The curly braces {} marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.
-> Each code statement must end with a semicolon.

-> println() method
Inside the main() method, we can use the println() method to print a line of text to the screen.
